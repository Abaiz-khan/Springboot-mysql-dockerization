# Dockerizing a Spring Boot Application with MySQL Server

This repository demonstrates how to dockerize a Spring Boot application that utilizes a MySQL server using Docker and Docker Compose.

NOTE :- This repo doesn't contains the whole source code 

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files and directories:

- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for the Spring Boot application.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the Docker Compose configuration for running the Spring Boot application and MySQL server.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the Spring Boot application.

## Prerequisites for a similar sprig boot application 

Before running the Docker containers, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the Spring Boot application and MySQL server using Docker Compose:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git-url
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd repository
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the Spring Boot application at:

   ```
   http://localhost:___
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The Spring Boot application connects to the MySQL server using the credentials defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. You can modify these credentials as needed.
- The MySQL data is persisted in a Docker volume to ensure that the data persists even if the containers are stopped or removed.
- Feel free to explore and modify the source code in the `src/` directory to suit your requirements.
